An elegant web framework designed to be simple, powerful and fast.

## Feature Overview

Spider-Gazelle employs some unique concepts, features, and design principles:

* Self documenting, can generate an [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) description of your project
* Annotations are used to define & configure routes, filters and error handlers
* Implements strong parameter typing with customisable parsing
* Parses request bodies and serialises responses based on [Accept](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept) and [Content-Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) headers
* Specs are simple to write, leveraging [HotTopic](https://github.com/jgaskins/hot_topic)
* Exceptions in development are helpful, leveraging [Exception Page](https://github.com/crystal-loot/exception_page)
* Puts you in control, customise command line options, when the server is started, how your app is configured etc
